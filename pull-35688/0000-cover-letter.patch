Subject: [PATCH 0/4] M11: Unify metrics views and M10: Metrics view: CVEs per branch section

Yocto currently maintains two views to display metrics: a multi-year and a single-year view.
Unifying them facilitates a more seamless user experience, and improves the maintenance of the website.
Yocto gathers the amount of CVEs per branch at the top of their metrics view.
However, the presentation of this information is not descriptive enough and it’s spread across several files.
This change adds collapsible, nested lists to show all cve information.

**Technical details:**
- Remove index-full.hmtl and only load the complete set of data
- Use pico.css to improve UX
- Use echarts and add a separate controls section (zoom) for this purpose and remove interactivity from the old charts themselves
- Load releases.csv only once
- Show current CVE count per release, parse json files with CVE lists to group them by project and display their total CVE count.
  Inline this data on the page in details elements so there’s no need to navigate away.

Note that there will be another patch for the autobuilder-helper project where we update the data that is used.

Please also note that there will be another milestone for improving the charts. It will improve performance, add descriptions and improve developer documentation.
