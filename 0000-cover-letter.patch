Subject: [PATCH 00/12] M12: Improve the Charts in the Metrics View

Yocto produces large amounts of statistical data measuring many aspects of project health over long periods of time. Making these more accessible, searchable, and understandable directly contributes to the project’s long-term usefulness and usability, saving maintainers and other consumers time and effort, as well as enabling more and better insights into the data, which in turn leads to more informed actions. Better display of stats also better communicates the effect of Yocto’s efforts. The work will reduce the time maintainers allocate to administrative and analytical tasks, enabling them to focus on core work and bug resolution.

Technical Details:

- Improve the charts: Add descriptions to help users understand the data better, add dark theme styles for charts
- Improve UX: Unify styles with other platforms for an overall cohesive look.
- Improve typography, colours, accessibility, and styles
- Improve the developer documentation: add README.md with local setup instructions
