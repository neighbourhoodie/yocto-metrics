+      <p>
+        The following two graphs provide insights into the status of patches in the OE-Core meta directory with respect to their upstream status.
+        The upstream status of a patch refers to its relationship with the original source or upstream project from which the patch originates.

+              The patch has been submitted upstream but hasn't received a definitive response yet.
+              Itâ€™s a transitional state between "Pending" and "Accepted" or "Rejected". Patches in this state are awaiting review and acceptance or rejection by upstream maintainers.

+          <dd>
